NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
4. Run the SQL script to create all tables, indexes, and policies

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

- Initial Assessment System
- Admin Dashboard & Analytics
- User Profile Management

### Development Features (Currently Disabled)
- Learning Pathway System
- Lesson Content & Quizzes
- Advanced Progress Tracking

Toggle features in `src/lib/featureFlags.ts`.

## Assessment Algorithm

### Difficulty Progression
- **Starting Point**: Level 5 (medium difficulty)
- **Correct Answer**: +0.5 difficulty
- **Incorrect Answer**: -1.0 difficulty
- **Range**: 1-10 difficulty scale

## Current Issues & Solutions

### Resolved Issues
- âœ… Module performance calculation (fixed database relationships)
- âœ… Netlify environment variable loading (runtime config fallback)
- âœ… Admin dashboard data access (service role key fallback)
- âœ… Assessment UI consistency (uniform sizing)
- âœ… Production build optimization (TypeScript fixes)

### Known Considerations
- Email confirmation redirects (configure Supabase URL settings for production)
- Feature flag management (easy toggle for enabling development features)
